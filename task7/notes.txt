Figure this bullshit out....

1. Start it up in Ghidra and find the main function (start at the top and work way down)

2. slowly look thru each of the functions
    a. gitGrabber() is the only one that really gets called in main
    b. within gitGrabber(), see line 29 and notice that the function opens a file (which is "/tmp/.gglock" when you call the function in GDB)
    c. looking at ospoimcwliqai function because it has uuid in it
    

    
OSPOIMCWLIQAI FUNCTION: takes in ip, 0x1a0a, output_00, and length
- looks to have most of information to establish a connection (username, version, os, timestamp (tv), messages, ciphertexts, my_uuid, fp, session_key, etc.)


Functions that I have looked at:
- gglockFileOpen
- ffsdzyanszqsw -> populates iVar1 (int)
- cxdtfmtpxijil -> takes in a stringstream and does git things (git_repository_open, git_revwalk, git_commit_lookup)
- ospoimcwliqai (note above)
- elcftaqudeovx -> takes in a ptr (used with &my_uuid) and size_t length -> memory allocator
- xajwbxqxoqasb -> sending stuff to the socket
- coxclamjiqjlw -> does something with magic start and magic end with the uuid
- pnsikqtljaxba -> another allocator
- orognarksdsdu -> allocator 
- jlnfxxpeavbex (vector) -> adding things to messages?
    - calls dbmndchjjvtfb which goes into a file?
- cesrjuratcsul -> setting magic_start, magic_end, cmd_param/length/data -> i think it is assigning info to them?
- 


The htons() function makes sure that numbers are stored in memory in network byte order, which is with the most significant byte first.
